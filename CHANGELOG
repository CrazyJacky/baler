*0.4.0* [06/09/09] - added ability to set multiple sources for a single class.
        [05/25/09] - added functionality for gather-time source resolution, i.e. the ability
                     alter the source's url for any single gather, using the :url_mapping option
        [05/19/09] - decided against previous extraction functionality as it up-front remote
                     fetching, and would needlessly complicate more important features.
        [04/13/09] - added functionality for extracting a value from the source, without
                     actually mapping it to a instance attribute

*0.3.0* [04/08/09] - implemented integration with ORM classes; Remote::Source#build_or_update
                     retrieves persistent instances based upon #set_lookup_attributes, or builds
                     a new instance when one is not found.
        [03/30/09] - added ability to specify a subset of attributes to be gathered.
        [03/29/09] - implemented conditional gathering. The source can define the conditions
                     for when it should or should not gather remote info, using #gather_if and
                     #gather_unless.
        [03/28/09] - added ability for mappings to forgo their source's context.

*0.2.0* [03/18/09] - implemented functionality for passing blocks to mappings. The array of specified
                     elements are passed to the block before the value is assigned to the attribute.
        [03/10/09] - implemented class method #build that returns an array of instances, once for each
                     context with the appropriate attribute values gathered.
        [02/21/09] - implemented Remote::Source#context which allows #map to specify relative paths.
        
*0.1.0* [02/07/09] - Initial release.
