*0.3.0* [04/08/09] - implemented integration with ORM classes; Remote::Source#build_or_update
                     retrieves persistent instances based upon #set_lookup_attributes, or builds
                     a new instance when one is not found.
        [03/28/09] - added ability for mappings to forgo their source's context
        [03/29/09] - implemented conditional gathering. The source can define the conditions
                     for when it should or should not gather remote info, using #gather_if and
                     #gather_unless
        [03/30/09] - added ability to specify a subset of attributes to be gathered

*0.2.0* [02/21/09] - implemented Remote::Source#context which allows #map to specify relative paths
        [03/10/09] - implemented class method #build that returns an array of instances, once for each
                     context with the appropriate attribute values gathered
        [03/18/09] - implemented functionality for passing blocks to mappings. The array of specified
                     elements are passed to the block before the value is assigned to the attribute

*0.1.0* [02/07/09] - Initial release
